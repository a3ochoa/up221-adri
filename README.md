# About me
Hello! I am a 1st year dual-degree MURP/MPH student with a focus on Design & Development. It's difficult for me to pin down my interests within Urban Planning, however I am interested in Urban Design and Community Health. I have previously worked in case managment/resident services for an LA-based affordable housing developer. I've also worked as an advocate in LAUSD's Foster Youth Services Coordinating Program, and helped to facilitate a Participatory Budgeting Process in Long Beach. I was born in the Central Valley, whose poor air and drinking water quality's impact on my family contributed to my interest in Public Health and Urban and Regional Planning. I enjoy tending to my plants, resting with my two cats (Thumper and Flower), hiking, park hangouts, and dive bars. 
I also have a background as a floral designer and currently work in a local floral studio making hand-tied bouquets. You can see my *very* poorly-maintained online portfolio [here.](https://fleurishandgrow.com/) 
## Description of Course
This course will:

- Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
- Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
## Project Ideas
I'm interested in ideas related to climate reliency and climate burden for vulneralble populations. I'm also interested in projects related to urban design and community health.  
## Objectives for the Class 
My hope is to gain tools to evaluate data related to urban planning and produce powerful visualization tools.
